# Python Documentation

## Overview
This documentation covers various versions of Python, a versatile programming language widely used for web development, data analysis, and more. It provides a comprehensive reference for Python's syntax, standard library, and built-in functions.

## Getting Started
- **Versions:** The documentation includes Python 3.10.18, 3.9.23, 3.11.13, 3.12.10, 3.13.7, 3.14.0rc2, and 3.15.0a0.
- **Installation:** Python can be installed on different platforms using the official installers or package managers.

## Core Functionality
- **Syntax Reference:** Detailed explanations of Python's syntax, including data types, operators, control flow, and more.
- **Standard Library:** Documentation for built-in modules like `json`, `os`, `sys`, and more, with code examples.
- **Built-in Functions:** Reference for built-in functions like `print()`, `len()`, `sorted()`, and more.

## Code Examples
### json Module
The `json` module provides JSON encoding and decoding capabilities.

```python
import json

# Encoding basic Python object hierarchies
data = ['foo', {'bar': ('baz', None, 1.0, 2)}]
encoded = json.dumps(data)
print(encoded)  # Output: ["foo", {"bar": ["baz", null, 1.0, 2]}]

# Decoding JSON
decoded = json.loads(encoded)
print(decoded)  # Output: ['foo', {'bar': ['baz', None, 1.0, 2]}]
```

## Other Modules
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
- `math`: Mathematical functions and constants.
- `datetime`: Working with dates and times.

## Configuration
Python's behavior can be customized through command-line arguments and environment variables. For example, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to add additional directories to the module search path.

## Common Use Cases
- **Web Development:** Python is often used with frameworks like Django or Flask for building web applications.
- **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas and NumPy enable data manipulation and analysis.
- **Automation:** Python's simplicity makes it ideal for scripting and automating tasks.

## API Reference
The documentation includes a comprehensive API reference for all built-in modules and functions, with detailed explanations and code examples.

## Troubleshooting
- **Common Errors:** The documentation provides solutions for common errors and exceptions.
- **Debugging:** Tips and techniques for debugging Python code.
- **Performance:** Optimizing Python code for speed and efficiency.

## Versions and Changes
The documentation covers multiple Python versions, each with its own set of changes and improvements. It's essential to refer to the specific version's documentation for accurate information.
